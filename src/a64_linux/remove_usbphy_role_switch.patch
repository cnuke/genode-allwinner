Remove usb-role-switch declaration as it leads to problems with
the 'dts/extract' tool where a broken .dts file is created.

Adding the 'axp803' node leads to a .dts file that does not work,
i.e., the USB host driver will not find any devices. Since for now
only the modem's USB ethernet device is used on the PinePhone we
may remove the declaration. This also breaks the HDMI feature
available via the USB-C port.
